# Enable sending email with meteor
## find out what the hell I was doing last time
  - something to do with sending emails from a meteor app with my gmail account
  + find yesterday's tutorial
    - found [a better one instead][ref2]
    - there's also [meteor's email documentation][ref1]
    - chose to use both `settings-production.json` and `.env` for this stuff
      - obviously, add it to `.gitignore`
      - added npm miniscript to load both of these automatically with `meteor npm start`
  + [try sending yourself a hello world][ref2]
    - [google blocks "less secure apps" from logging in][ref2]
    - enable "less secure app" access (will not work from 30th of April onwards)
